# SG QR Inspector!

With this little app, you can:

* Inspect any SG QR code
* Combine multiple SG-QR codes into one
* Add PayNow as an option to any SG-QR code.

This means that, with **one QR code**, you can offer any number of payment methods, like **NETS, PayNow, FavePay, GrabPay, ...**.

# Why this App?

Because PayNow is the better option (unless you have specific business needs):

![diagram showing NETS QR is only compatible with a few banks; but PayNow is compatible with all Singapore banks!](/docs/compatibility.png)

NETS QRs are only compatible with a very limited number of banks in Singapore. However, PayNow is compatible with almost all banks in Singapore,
plus some other apps like GrabPay and Google Pay.

By adding PayNow support to your payment QR codes, you reach the widest audience, and will not exclude customers on smaller banks
